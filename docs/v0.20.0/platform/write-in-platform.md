# Write Records to Streams

After creating a stream, you can write records to it according to the needs of your application.
This page describes how to write and get records in HStream Platform.

## Preparation

To write records, you need to create a stream first.

1. If you do not have a stream, please refer to [Create a Stream](./stream-in-platform.md#create-a-stream) to create a stream.

2. Go into any stream you want to write records to on the **Streams** page.

3. Click the **Write records** button to write records to the stream.

## Write records

A record is like a piece of JSON data. You can add arbitrary fields to a record, only ensure that the record is a valid JSON object.

A record also ships with a partition key, which is used to determine which shard the record will be allocated to and improve the read/write performance.

::: tip
For more details about the partition key, please refer to [Partition Key](../develop/write/write.md#write-records-with-partition-keys).
:::

Take the following steps to write records to a stream:

1. Specify the optional **Key**. This is the partition key of the record. The server will automatically assign a default key to the record if not provided.

2. Fill in the **Value**. This is the content of the record. It must be a valid JSON object.

3. Click the **Produce** button to write the record to the stream.

4. If the record is written successfully, you will see a success message below the **Produce** button.

5. If the record is written failed, you will see a failure message below the **Produce** button.

## Get Records

After writing records to a stream, you can get records from the **Records** page or the **Stream Details** page.

### Get records from the Records page

After navigating to the **Records** page, you can get records from a stream.

Below are several filters you can use to get records:

- **Stream**: Select the stream you want to get records.
- **Shard**: Select one of the shards in the stream you want to get records.
- Special filters:
  - **Start record ID**: Get records after a specified record ID. The default is the first record.
  - **Start date**: Get records after a specified date.

::: info
The **Stream** and **Shard** will be filled automatically after loading the page.
By default, the filled value is the first stream and the first shard in the stream.
You can change them to get records from other streams.
:::

::: info
We default to showing at most **100 records** after getting. If you want to get more records,
please specify a recent record ID in the **Start record ID** field or a recent date in the **Start date** field.
:::

After filling in the filters, click the **Get records** button to get records.

For each record, you can view the following information:

1. The **ID** of the record.
2. The **Key** of the record.
3. The **Value** of the record.
4. The **Shard ID** of the record.
5. The **Creation time** of the record.

In the next section, you will learn how to get records from the Stream Details page.

### Get records from the Stream Details page

Similar to [Get records from Records page](#get-records-from-the-records-page),
you can also get records from the **Stream Details** page.

The difference is that you can get records without specifying the stream.
The records will automatically be retrieved from the stream you are currently viewing.

For more details, please refer to [Get records in a stream](./stream-in-platform.md#get-records-in-a-stream).
