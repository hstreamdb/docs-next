# Quickstart with Docker-Compose

## Requirement

For optimal performance, we suggest utilizing a Linux kernel version of 4.14 or
higher when initializing an HStreamDB Cluster.

::: tip
In the case it is not possible for the user to use a Linux kernel version of
4.14 or above, we recommend adding the option `--enable-dscp-reflection=false`
to HStore while starting the HStreamDB Cluster.
:::

## Installation

### Install docker

::: tip
If you have already installed docker, you can skip this step.
:::

See [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), and
install it for your operating system. Please carefully check that you have met
all prerequisites.

Confirm that the Docker daemon is running:

```sh
docker version
```

::: tip
On Linux, Docker needs root privileges. You can also run Docker as a
non-root user, see [Post-installation steps for Linux][non-root-docker].
:::

### Install docker compose

::: tip
If you have already installed docker compose, you can skip this step.
:::

See [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), and
install it for your operating system. Please carefully check that you met all
prerequisites.

```sh
docker-compose version
```

## Start HStreamDB Services

::: warning
Do NOT use this configuration in your production environment!
:::

Create a docker-compose.yaml file for docker compose, you can
[download][quick-start.yaml] or paste the following contents:

<<< @/../assets/quick-start.yaml.template{yaml-vue}

then run:

```sh
docker-compose -f quick-start.yaml up
```

If you see some thing like this, then you have a running hstream:

```txt
hserver_1    | [INFO][2021-11-22T09:15:18+0000][app/server.hs:137:3][thread#67]************************
hserver_1    | [INFO][2021-11-22T09:15:18+0000][app/server.hs:145:3][thread#67]Server started on port 6570
hserver_1    | [INFO][2021-11-22T09:15:18+0000][app/server.hs:146:3][thread#67]*************************
```

::: tip
You can also run in background:
```sh
docker-compose -f quick-start.yaml up -d
```
:::

::: tip
If you want to show logs of server, run:
```sh
docker-compose -f quick-start.yaml logs -f hserver
```
:::

## Connect HStreamDB with HSTREAM CLI

HStreamDB can be directly managed using the `hstream` command-line interface (CLI), which is included in the `hstreamdb/hstream` image.

Start an instance of `hstreamdb/hstream` using Docker:

```sh-vue
docker run -it --rm --name some-hstream-cli --network host hstreamdb/hstream:{{ $version() }} bash
```

## Create stream

To create a stream, you can use `hstream stream create` command. Now we will create a stream with 2 shard

```sh
hstream stream create demo --shards 2
```

```sh
+-------------+---------+----------------+-------------+
| Stream Name | Replica | Retention Time | Shard Count |
+-------------+---------+----------------+-------------+
| demo        | 1       | 604800 seconds | 2           |
+-------------+---------+----------------+-------------+
```

## Write data to streams

The `hstream stream append` command can be used to write data to a stream in a interactive shell.
```sh
hstream stream append demo --separator "@"
```
- With the `--separator` option, you can specify the separator for key. The default separator is "@". Using the separator, you can assign a key to each record. Record with same key will be append into same shard of the stream.

```sh
key1@{"temperature": 22, "humidity": 80}
key1@{"temperature": 32, "humidity": 21, "tag": "tes1"}
hello world!
```
Here we have written three pieces of data. The first two are in JSON format and are associated with key1. The last one does not specify a key.

For additional information, you can use `hstream stream append -h`.

## Read data from a stream

To read data from a particular stream, the `hstream stream read-stream` command is used.

```sh
hstream stream read-stream demo
```

```sh
timestamp: "1692774821444", id: 1928822601796943-8589934593-0, key: "key1", record: {"humidity":80.0,"temperature":22.0}
timestamp: "1692774844649", id: 1928822601796943-8589934594-0, key: "key1", record: {"humidity":21.0,"tag":"test1","temperature":32.0}
timestamp: "1692774851017", id: 1928822601796943-8589934595-0, key: "", record: hello world!
```

You can also set a read offset, which can be one of the following typesï¼š

- `earliest`: This seeks to the first record of the stream.
- `latest`: This seeks to the end of the stream.
- `timestamp`: This seeks to a record with a specific creation timestamp.

For instance:

```sh
hstream stream read-stream demo --from 1692774844649 --total 1
```

```sh
timestamp: "1692774844649", id: 1928822601796943-8589934594-0, key: "key1", record: {"humidity":21.0,"tag":"test1","temperature":32.0}
```

## Start HStreamDB's interactive SQL CLI

```sh-vue
docker run -it --rm --name some-hstream-cli --network host hstreamdb/hstream:{{ $version() }} hstream --port 6570 sql
```

If everything works fine, you will enter an interactive CLI and see help
information like

```txt
      __  _________________  _________    __  ___
     / / / / ___/_  __/ __ \/ ____/   |  /  |/  /
    / /_/ /\__ \ / / / /_/ / __/ / /| | / /|_/ /
   / __  /___/ // / / _, _/ /___/ ___ |/ /  / /
  /_/ /_//____//_/ /_/ |_/_____/_/  |_/_/  /_/

Command
  :h                           To show these help info
  :q                           To exit command line interface
  :help [sql_operation]        To show full usage of sql statement

SQL STATEMENTS:
  To create a simplest stream:
    CREATE STREAM stream_name;

  To create a query select all fields from a stream:
    SELECT * FROM stream_name EMIT CHANGES;

  To insert values to a stream:
    INSERT INTO stream_name (field1, field2) VALUES (1, 2);

>
```

## Run a continuous query over the stream

Now we can run a continuous query over the stream we just created by `SELECT`
query.

The query will output all records from the `demo` stream whose humidity is above
70 percent.

```sql
SELECT * FROM demo WHERE humidity > 70 EMIT CHANGES;
```

It seems that nothing happened. But do not worry because there is no data in the
stream now. Next, we will fill the stream with some data so the query can
produce output we want.

## Start another CLI session

Start another CLI session, this CLI will be used for inserting data into the
stream.

```sh
docker exec -it some-hstream-cli hstream --port 6570 sql
```

## Insert data into the stream

Run each of the given `INSERT` statement in the new CLI session and keep an eye
on the CLI session created in (2).

```sql
INSERT INTO demo (temperature, humidity) VALUES (22, 80);
INSERT INTO demo (temperature, humidity) VALUES (15, 20);
INSERT INTO demo (temperature, humidity) VALUES (31, 76);
INSERT INTO demo (temperature, humidity) VALUES ( 5, 45);
INSERT INTO demo (temperature, humidity) VALUES (27, 82);
INSERT INTO demo (temperature, humidity) VALUES (28, 86);
```

If everything works fine, the continuous query will output matching records in
real time:

```json
{"humidity":{"$numberLong":"80"},"temperature":{"$numberLong":"22"}}
{"humidity":{"$numberLong":"76"},"temperature":{"$numberLong":"31"}}
{"humidity":{"$numberLong":"82"},"temperature":{"$numberLong":"27"}}
{"humidity":{"$numberLong":"86"},"temperature":{"$numberLong":"28"}}
```

## Start Discovery HStreamDB using CONSOLE

The HStreamDB Console is the management panel for HStreamDB. You can use it to manage most resources of HStreamDB, perform data reading and writing, execute SQL queries, and more.

You can open the Console panel by entering http://localhost:5177 into your browser.

Now, you can start exploring HStreamDB with joy.
