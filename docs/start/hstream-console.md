# Get Started on HStream Console

HStream Console is a web-based management tool for HStreamDB. It provides a graphical user interface to manage HStreamDB clusters.
With HStream Console, you can easily create and manage streams, and write SQL queries to process data in real time. Besides operating HStreamDB,
HStream Console also provides metrics for each resource in the cluster, which helps you to monitor the cluster status.

## Features

### Manage HStreamDB resources directly

HStream Console provides a graphical user interface to manage HStreamDB resources, including streams, subscriptions, and queries.
You can easily create and delete resources in the cluster, write data to streams, and write SQL queries to process data.

It can also help you to search for resources in the cluster, and provide a detailed view of each resource.

### Monitor resources in the cluster

In every resource view, HStream Console provides a metrics panel to monitor the resource status in real-time. With the metrics panel,
you can intuitively visualize the resource status, and easily find out the bottleneck of the cluster.

### Data synchronization

With connectors in HStream Console, you can gain the ability to synchronize data between HStreamDB and other data sources, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Elasticsearch.
Check out [HStream IO Overview](../develop/ingest-and-distribute/overview.md) to learn more about connectors.
