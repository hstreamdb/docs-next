## Write records to the stream

After creating a stream, you can write records to the stream. Go to the stream details page by clicking the stream name in the table and
then click the **Write records** button. A drawer will appear, and you can write records to the stream in the drawer.

In this example, we will write the following record to the stream:

```json
{ "name": "Alice", "age": 18 }
```

Please fill it in the **Value** Field and click the **Produce** button.

If the record is written successfully, you will see a success message and the response
of the request.

Next, we can query this record from the stream.

After writing records to the stream, you can get records from the stream. Go back
to the stream page, click the **Records** tab, you will see a empty table.

Click the **Get records** button, and then the record written in the previous step will be displayed.
